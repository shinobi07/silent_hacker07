      <h2><strong>PART 1: COMING UP WITH IDEAS</strong></h2>
      <p>Before building something, you will need an idea of your app. What does it do? How does it looks? etc.</p>

      <h2><strong>PART 2: BUILDING</strong></h2>
      <p>If you want to build a software or maybe a website like mine, you'll have to do some steps here</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose a programming language</li>
        <li>Install the programming language</li>
        <li>Learn the fundamentals from the language</li>
        <li>Looking for references to build your projects</li>
      </ol>
